Whats the defferent between undefined and null in javascript.

Undefined means variables has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

var test2;
console.log(test2);
// undefined
undefined is a type.




Null is a assigment value,it can be assigned to a variable as a reprentation of no value.
Also means empty,nothing.

var test1=null;
console.log(test1);
// null
null is an object.
